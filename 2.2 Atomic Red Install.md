### Atomic Red Team is an open-source library of tests that security teams can use to simulate adversarial activity in their environments.

Atomic Red Team has two key components:
- Library of Scripted Attacks: A comprehensive collection of pre-scripted attack techniques.
- Optional Execution Framework: A tool that reads from the library and executes the scripted attacks according to specified parameters.

- <span style="color:red"> Note: </span> Before installing the Atomic Red Team framework, we need to bypass some security checks. It is important to note that at this stage, we are not attempting to bypass existing EPP/EDR or OS-level security settings. Our goal is to simulate a basic adversary attack and investigate it to see if we can log the event. It’s possible that we already have the necessary security products and tools in place and only need to fine-tune our defense system.

1. Temporarily bypass the execution policy
```ps
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass –Scope CurrentUSer
```

2. Exclude the “AtomicRedTeam” folder
```ps
Add-MpPreference –ExclusionPath C:\AtomicRedTeam
```

3. Install Execution Framework and Atomics Folder on the Windows client machine. 
```ps
IEX (IWR 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redcanaryco/invoke-atomicredteam/master/install-atomicredteam.ps1' -UseBasicParsing); Install-AtomicRedTeam –getAtomics -Force
```

4. Import the Module
```ps
Import-Module "C:\AtomicRedTeam\invoke-atomicredteam\Invoke-AtomicRedTeam.psd1" -Force
```

5. Add the Import to your PowerShell Profile
```ps
Import-Module "C:\AtomicRedTeam\invoke-atomicredteam\Invoke-AtomicRedTeam.psd1" -Force 
$PSDefaultParameterValues = @{"Invoke-AtomicTest:PathToAtomicsFolder"="C:\AtomicRedTeam\atomics"}
```

6. Make sure everything works correctly
```ps
PS C:\AtomicRedTeam> Get-Module

ModuleType Version Name ExportedCommands

...
```

7. Disable Windows Defender
```ps
PS C:\> Set-MpPreference -DisableRealtimeMonitoring $true
